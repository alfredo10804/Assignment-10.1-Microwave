Description of Class: 


The class I created (MicrowaveOven) is based on a microwave object that will display a menu and let the user choose different options to warm up different types of food. The second class (cooking_food) will start to heat up the food based on the data generated by the MicrowaveOven class. 


Description of Variables: 


get_foodid - Number that is selected by the user 


time - The cooking time corresponding to each option 


foodname - The name of the different food options 


pounds - The amount of pounds imputed by the user when using the defrost option 


program_list - The dictionary containing the different food names in correlation to their option number 


Description of Each Method: 


default_heat_programs - Creates the menu that is displayed to the user based on the dictionary     “program_list” class variable and asks the user to input the foodId of their choice.


get_foodId - Obtains the get_foodId that the user inputs in the previous method (default_heat_programs).


get_cooking_time - Based on the food that the user selected, the cooking time, pounds for the defrost option, and food name will be provided by this method.


start - Based on the minutes that are imputed by the user in the “custom time” option, the program will multiply the minutes by 60 since there are 60 seconds in a minute. The program will then display the progress made when cooking the food in percentages until the food is fully cooked.


Description of Demo Program: 


My demo program is designed to simulate a microwave in which one can choose from seven different options that would be available on a real microwave. One can choose to either cook popcorn, warm up pizza, cook a baked potato, cook a veggie snack, defrost anything of your choice, set a custom time, or turn off the microwave. The program will then start a timer depending on what option is chosen. Time will be displayed in percentages in order to show the user the progress in their food cooking. If any of the first six options are chosen, the program will continue running until you input the last option (turning off the microwave). 


How to Run the Demo Program: 


Initialize the program and input the option of your choice (numbered 1-7). You may keep inputting other options one after another until you turn off the microwave (option 7) hence, ending the program.
